# Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI Guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, Android/Google, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).
Focus on touch-related elements.

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Android:
  https://developer.android.com/design/index.html
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

HCI Guidline One (URL): https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/visual-design/color/
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
-Remove unnecessary bg-color border on Headers for sections and login button.
-Use the Apple described red on user interactive things, white on reading areas, and gray on empty space

* HCI Guidline Two (URL): https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/user-interaction/3d-touch/
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
-Peek on the image to reveal the whole banner image used on the current desktop version

* HCI Guidline Three (URL): https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/visual-design/branding/
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
-Remove unnecessary details like the "Illinois institute of technology" text and the complex black pattern.
-Change it to just the solid, apple red, with offblack "my IIT" text inside a while bubble all the way to the
left.
-Simply put, "defer to content," "onubtrusive," and "remove logo throughout app."
