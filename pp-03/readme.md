## ITMD 362, Production Problem 03: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette
(you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make).
Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode Default with Text http://paletton.com/

1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kv6fk8WnLlwklNva3+v2+
Your Rationale: If you look at any gaming website or device, such as MSI https://us.msi.com/ 
or Asus ROG https://rog.asus.com/ , it become apparent that this is a color palette gamers
have been both adapted to, and have associated directly with receiving content. It also stands
out from Sony, Nintendo, Microsoft, Steam, and Origin's color pallettes. With proper usage
and proportions, it is possible to make a white, gray, black, and dark red pallette based
service that isn't an eyesore.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=55g0k0kjbJx00++9eTzs9D8Kfql
Your Rationale: Simply put, I chose the adjacent color pallette that had the most common flower
colors. This one only lacks yellow, and yellow is a rough color to deal with anyway for a
website. A nice, muted violent, purple-ish pink, and red.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=3000u0krGr63EzOgLugzEkpU1c+
Your Rationale: A nice, friendly, red green and blue that don't melt your eyes when you look at
them. They have that "kid feel" that's hard to explain, too.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=12S0u0k++za00K+HTYQ+ZmL++1U
Your Rationale: Based on the generic hacker "colorset" of offwhite, black, and neon green. Has
good association with the prompt. So much so that it's instantly identifiable. And, as an ad,
you care more about association and attention than subtlety.
