# Production Problem 05: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability
problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is
to locate at least 2 different usability checklists each containing at least 25 items (use Google,
but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own,
condensed list of exactly ten items.

Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create
your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you've found:

2.https://internetdevels.com/blog/50-point-checklist-for-website-usability-testing

* Your own condensed, ten-item must-have usability checklist:

1. It is clear that your website is about and who you are.
2. It is clear what the user is doing.
3. It is clear where the user can go (navigate to).
4. There are no redundancies or conflicting links or content.
5. Follow a general template for all of your pages.
6. Create a general map for your entire website.
7. Follow general practices like the site logo being a link to the home page.
8. Split large forms into multiple pages.
9. Make forms as small as possible
10. Make your color code to specific things or actions
