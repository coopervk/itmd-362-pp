# Production Problem 05: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability
problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is
to locate at least 2 different usability checklists each containing at least 25 items (use Google,
but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own,
condensed list of exactly ten items.

Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create
your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists youve found:

1.https://wsuwp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/sites/7/2015/08/25-point-usability-checklist-final.pdf (Replace WSU with your org)
2.https://internetdevels.com/blog/50-point-checklist-for-website-usability-testing

* Your own condensed, ten-item must-have usability checklist:

1. The purpose of your website is obvious.
2. The user should be able to easily tell where they are and what they are doing.
3. Navigation options are obvious.
4. There is no redundancy or conflicting content; links or content.
5. Use a "loose template" template for all of your pages.
6. Create a general map for your entire website.
7. Follow general practices like the site logo being a link to the home page.
8. Split large forms into multiple pages.
9. Make forms as small as possible.
10. Make your color code to specific things or actions.
